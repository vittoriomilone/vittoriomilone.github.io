<p>I found this method to upload images etc to github without using git/the command line relatively useful to build simple pages with the automatic generator: <a href="http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/">http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/</a><br></p>

<p><br>I ran into some problems with the multidigit 7-segment display: I bought the one from EOO (LTC-5837WC) <a href="http://www.eoo-bv.nl/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=8390">http://www.eoo-bv.nl/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=8390</a>, but it seems differently wired compared to the other one <a href="https://iprototype.nl/docs/led-bar-4xsegment-red-technisch-datasheet.pdf">https://iprototype.nl/docs/led-bar-4xsegment-red-technisch-datasheet.pdf</a>. </p>

<p>Before buying it I did not notice that it has 40 pins, the other 16 : according to the datasheet of the former, (<a href="http://datasheet.octopart.com/LTC-5837WC-Lite-On-datasheet-13708537.pdf">http://datasheet.octopart.com/LTC-5837WC-Lite-On-datasheet-13708537.pdf</a>) the difference seems to be that the "corresponding" segments of each digit are not linked together, which makes difficult to control the display with an arduino uno as more pins than the total amount available on the board would be needed (it seems to be not "multiplexing-ready"). </p>

<p>I had to manually link each of the corresponding segments to each other on the breadboard in order to get it to work.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the mess, just to give an idea of the situation on the breadboard... ;-):<br></p>

<p><br>In order to get the four needed lenses, I tried to take apart some single-use cameras from kruidvat as suggested. Reading about the potential dangers of the high voltage circuit with charged capacitor connected to the flash unit, I tried to get some rubber/insulated gloves like the ones electricians use, but no one I asked had anything similar at the fablab.
Then I tried with a spatula with a wooden handle and although working very cautiously the camera emitted a spark near the battery compartment (battery had already been removed), also relatively away from the flash unit.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am still alive... :-)<br></p>
