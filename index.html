<p>I found this method to upload images etc to github without using git/the command line relatively useful to build simple pages with the automatic generator: <a href="http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/">http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/</a></p>

<a id="the-incubator" class="anchor" href="#the-incubator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The incubator</h3>

<p>I ran into some problems with the multidigit 7-segment display: I bought the one from EOO (LTC-5837WC) <a href="http://www.eoo-bv.nl/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=8390">http://www.eoo-bv.nl/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=8390</a>, but it seems differently wired compared to the other one <a href="https://iprototype.nl/docs/led-bar-4xsegment-red-technisch-datasheet.pdf">https://iprototype.nl/docs/led-bar-4xsegment-red-technisch-datasheet.pdf</a>. </p>

<p>Before buying it I did not notice that it has 40 pins, the other 16 : according to the datasheet of the former, (<a href="http://datasheet.octopart.com/LTC-5837WC-Lite-On-datasheet-13708537.pdf">http://datasheet.octopart.com/LTC-5837WC-Lite-On-datasheet-13708537.pdf</a>) the difference seems to be that the "corresponding" segments of each digit are not linked together, which makes difficult to control the display with an arduino uno as more pins than the total amount available on the board would be needed (it seems to be not "multiplexing-ready"). </p>

<p>I had to manually link each of the corresponding segments to each other on the breadboard in order to get it to work.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the mess, just to give an idea of the situation on the breadboard... ;-):</p>

<a id="the-microscope" class="anchor" href="#the-microscope" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The microscope</h3>

<p>In order to get the four needed lenses, I tried to take apart some single-use cameras from kruidvat as suggested. Reading about the potential dangers of the high voltage circuit with charged capacitor connected to the flash unit, I tried to get some rubber/insulated gloves like the ones electricians use, but no one I asked had anything similar at the fablab.
Then I tried with a spatula with a wooden handle and although working very cautiously the camera emitted a spark near the battery compartment (battery had already been removed), also relatively away from the flash unit.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am still alive... :-)</p>

<a id="the-microscope2" class="anchor" href="#the-microscope2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The microscope/2</h3>

<p>I was stimulated by some part of the lecture about the calculation of the magnification obtainable by the webcam microscope, and I tried to establish how much mine was magnifying. </p>

<p>With relation to the 640x480 image i was seeing on my scren, which measured at 100% size 16x12cm with about 3 observable pixels in it, I tried to calculate the actual size of a pixel on my screen: </p>

<p>my display has a native resolution of 1366X768 (10.11" × 5.68" = 57.48in² (25.68cm × 14.44cm = 370.86cm²) at 135.09 PPI, 0.188mm dot pitch, 18250 PPI² ) which makes a single pixel about 1/18250 I². </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sven.de/dpi/">https://www.sven.de/dpi/</a></p>

<p>The image of a single pixel I have obtained is about 64cm², that is 9.92 square inches</p>

<p>So the magnification on the screen should be: 9.92 / (1/18250)= 181.040 times! </p>

<p>But this is not the actual magnification of the microscope, as I think that should be calculated against the area of the webcam image sensor:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.siliconimaging.com/Lens%20Image%20formats.htm">http://www.siliconimaging.com/Lens%20Image%20formats.htm</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format#Table_of_sensor_formats_and_sizes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format#Table_of_sensor_formats_and_sizes</a></p>

<p>Considering an image sensor of about 1/4" (or less), we can calculate the area of the sensor as about 7.68 square mm, that is 0.076 square cm (0.0119 square inches), and obtain a final calculation of (0.0119/3)/(1/18250) =  approximately 72.391 times with a 1/4" sensor, but up to 7 times less in case of smaller image sensors.</p>

<p>yeast extract, aeration, pH and temperature produced
the most dramatic effects</p>

<p>per litre of deionized water:
yeast extract (Fisher Scientific), 5 g; tryptone (Fisher Scientific), 5 g;
NaCI, 30 g; Na2HPO4,, 5 g; KH2PO4, I g; glycerol, 3 ml.</p>

<p>The liquid cultures were grown in
Erlenmeyer flasks with cotton plugs with the volume of sterile medium 115 the volume of the
flask. The cultures were incubated at 15 "C, unless specified otherwise, with vigorous shaking.</p>

<p>Bacteria for extraction of luciferase were harvested
by centrifuging in an RC-2B Sorvall centrifuge with a GSArotor at 10 ooorev/min for I 5 min.
For the light measurements in vitro the organisms were lysed in deionized water and the
debris removed by centrifuging as described above. </p>

<p>Growth at both pH 6.0 and 6.5 gave maximum luminescence rates per bacterium. The growth rate and yield was about 50 % higher at pH 6-5 than at pH 6.0. Therefore, the bacterium
was cultured in the standard medium at pH 6.5. </p>

<p>Bacterial bioluminescence is absolutely dependent upon oxygen. Vigorous shaking of
cultures grown in flasks as described in Methods was adequate to produce maximum
luminescence rate per bacterium without additional aerating apparatus. </p>
