Reading about the potential dangers of the high voltage circuit with charged capacitor connected to the flash unit, I tried to get some rubber/insulated gloves like the ones electricians use, but no one I asked had anything similar at the fablab.\r\nThen I tried with a spatula with a wooden handle and although working very cautiously the camera emitted a spark near the battery compartment (battery had already been removed), also relatively away from the flash unit.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I am still alive... :-)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
