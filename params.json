Reading about the potential dangers of the high voltage circuit with charged capacitor connected to the flash unit, I tried to get some rubber/insulated gloves like the ones electricians use, but no one I asked had anything similar at the fablab.\r\nThen I tried with a spatula with a wooden handle and although working very cautiously the camera emitted a spark near the battery compartment (battery had already been removed), also relatively away from the flash unit.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I am still alive... :-)\r\n\r\nOther interesting resources about DIY microscopy:\r\n\r\nCellphone microscopy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5H6uSQUFE \r\n\r\nMaking a LEGO microscope: http://www.microbehunter.com/making-a-lego-microscope/\r\n\r\nMake webcams work in Linux https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam\r\n \r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\n### The microscope/2\r\n\r\nI was stimulated by some part of the lecture about the calculation of the magnification obtainable by the webcam microscope, and I tried to establish how much mine was magnifying. \r\n\r\nWith relation to the 640x480 image i was seeing on my scren, which measured at 100% size 16x12cm with about 3 observable pixels in it, I tried to calculate the actual size of a pixel on my screen: \r\n\r\nmy display has a native resolution of 1366X768 (10.11\" × 5.68\" = 57.48in² (25.68cm × 14.44cm = 370.86cm²) at 135.09 PPI, 0.188mm dot pitch, 18250 PPI² ) which makes a single pixel about 1/18250 I². \r\n\r\nhttps://www.sven.de/dpi/\r\n\r\nThe image of a single pixel I have obtained is about 64cm², that is 9.92 square inches\r\n\r\nSo the magnification on the screen should be: 9.92 / (1/18250)= 181.040 times! \r\n\r\nBut this is not the actual magnification of the microscope, as I think that should be calculated against the area of the webcam image sensor:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.siliconimaging.com/Lens%20Image%20formats.htm\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format#Table_of_sensor_formats_and_sizes\r\n\r\nConsidering an image sensor of about 1/4\" (or less), we can calculate the area of the sensor as about 7.68 square mm, that is 0.076 square cm, and obtain a final calculation of (0.076/3)/ (1/18250) =  approximately 476 times with a 1/4\" sensor*, but up to 7 times less in case of smaller image sensors.\r\n\r\nOther resources:\r\n\r\nhttp://web2.0calc.com/\r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Microscope/?ALLSTEPS\r\n\r\nhttp://hackteria.org/wiki/index.php/Laser-cut_microscopy_stages in\r\nparticolare il kit con il microscopio con il servo motor ed arduino\r\n\r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/?ALLSTEPS\r\n\r\n### Preview of the prototypes\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11046601/6687801/9f0ae078-ccae-11e4-937b-443c4640ece6.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
